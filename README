To build this program, simply run "ghc --make histogram" (no quotation marks) at the command line.
To run this program on a file or group of files, do "./histogram file1 file2 ..."
    ex: ./histogram tom_sawyer.txt othello.txt 1984.txt
To run this program so that it takes input from stdin, run it with "./histogram"
    ex: cat war_and_peace.txt | ./histogram
